What are we doing?
  Building a JavaScript interpreter
  It's common amongst us all
  The other idea I had turned out to be too complex


Why?
  Remove the magic that makes languages 
    difficult to reason about
  Gain deep insights into the languages we use
    The interpreter is the definition of the language
    (in practice)
  It's fun!

  Might know me from Ruby:
    Seeing Is Believing or the Pry video


Why am I qualified to teach this?
  ehhhh.....
  I'm just playing around to figure it out
  like all the rest of us ^_^


What is an interpreter?
  A program that implements a programming language
  
  In our case, a program that will:
    * Parse a program into a data structure
    * Traverse that data structure
    * Manipulate internal state based on the traversal
    * Interact with the machine at the appropriate times


!Setup
  Find a pair who is comfortable with JS
  $ git clone github.com/JoshCheek/interpreter-for-scna

  Install deps
  $ npm install

  Run tests
  $ npm run test_progression

  
Parsing
  String -> AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

  A tree structure that represents syntax
  But discards syntactic noise
  (eg the individual digits of a number)

  Try running `esparse examples/primitive_number.js`
  (pipe it through `jq .` for highlighting)

Conventions
  objects will be simple JS objects
  We'll give each one a type
  Types are: number, string, boolean, nil, object, array

  Based on the type, we'll expect other keys to be set,


!Switching on type
  notice the type corresponds to a case in the statement
  lets run the tests and work our way through the primitives


Iterating over the structure
  It's a tree, so iterate the same way as any other tree:
  from a node, iterate over each of its children
  in some order (usually left to right)

  For us, each node will have its own rules,
  we'll use its type to figure out which
  the `evaluate` method will have a case for each possible type


Updating state
  State is data that can change

  For some nodes, like an assignment,
  we will want to update some state.
  In that case, the local variables of a function.
  

3 structures
  As far as I can tell, there are three structures
  that allow JavaScript to work:
  
  A linked list called the stack
    It tracks `this`, and variables
    if we got further, we'd store these variables
    to a function instead

  A linked list called inheritance
    where each object stores data called "properties"
    and has a link to the next node in the list as its prototype

  A linked list called lexical scope
    Where each function stores the local variables
    and has a link called its "environment" or "context"
    to the variables of the function that defined it
  
  All of the behaviour we observe in JS
    emerges from the manipulation of these three structures
